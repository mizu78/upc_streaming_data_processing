### üñ•Ô∏è Configuring your client

- Create an API key. 
- Save the key somewhere for safety.

#### 2. Create your topic
You can follow the tutorial of Confluent page, where you can copy the code with the variables already filled. Otherwise, you can take a look hereunder.

Using the following command in your terminal, and replace the following placeholders:
- `<name_of_topic_to_replace>`: replace with your topic name
- `<your-server-address>`: in your cluster details
- `<base64-encoded-API-key-and-secret>`: base64-encoded API key and secret in the following format `<key>:<secret>`
```
curl \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Basic <base64-encoded-API-key-and-secret>" \
  https://<your-server-address>:443/kafka/v3/clusters/lkc-npk70k/topics \
  -d '{"topic_name":"<name_of_topic_to_replace>"}'
```

Once this command is run successfully, your new topic will be displayed in the Confluent console (not in the tutorial page).

You can also copy the details for configuration on client-side for later use: 

```
# Required connection configs for Kafka producer, consumer, and admin
bootstrap.servers=<your-server-address>:9092
security.protocol=SASL_SSL
sasl.mechanisms=PLAIN
sasl.username={{ CLUSTER_API_KEY }}
sasl.password={{ CLUSTER_API_SECRET }}

session.timeout.ms=45000

```
